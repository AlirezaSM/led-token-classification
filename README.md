# Benchmarking methods for label error detection in token classification data

Code to reproduce results from the paper:

[**Detecting Label Errors in Token Classification Data**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03920)

This repository is only for intended for scientific purposes. To find label errors in your own token classification data, you should instead use [the implementation](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/token_classification.html) from the official [cleanlab library](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab).
